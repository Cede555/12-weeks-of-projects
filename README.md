# 12-weeks-of-projects
A challenge i've set myself to learn different web technologies, starting simple and ramping up over time!


Week 1 - RockPaperScissors using JS to further my WebJS skills.
Week 2 -  A C++ based parser that reads Nmap scripts, takes the open ports and places them in an array for further parsing/comparison (creating a database of vulns in the works bout outside scope for now)
